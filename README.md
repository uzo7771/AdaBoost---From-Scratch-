# AdaBoost Model

This project implements the AdaBoost algorithm using Regression Trees as weak learners in Python. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model. The focus here is on regression tasks.

## Features:
- AdaBoost Algorithm: Implements the AdaBoost algorithm for regression tasks.
- Weak Learners: Uses Regression Trees as weak learners.
- Weighted Sampling: Performs weighted sampling of the training data to focus on difficult-to-predict observations.
- Weighted Median Prediction: Combines predictions from multiple weak learners using a weighted median approach.

## Dependencies
This project depends on the RegressionTree class, which is implemented in another repository. To use the AdaBoost, you need to download the Regression-Trees---From-Scratch repository and place its code in the appropriate folder.
